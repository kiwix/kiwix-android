Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. It's especially thought to
make Wikipedia available offline.  This is done by reading the content
of the project stored in a file format ZIM, a high compressed open
format with additional meta-data.

*********************************************************************
************* COMPILATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANDROID ******************
*********************************************************************

Android is just an additional target but you can still build for
Android only from a Linux or Mac (it cross-compiles).

* ./autogen.sh

* ./configure --disable-staticbins --disable-manager --disable-server --disable-launcher --disable-indexer --disable-installer --disable-searcher --disable-reader --disable-components --enable-android --enable-compileall

* cd src/dependencies && make android-deps && cd -

* cd android && ./build-android-with-native.py (If you have problem with aapt on a 64bits Linux, you might have to install 32 libsm on Ubuntu: lib32gcc1, lib32stdc++6, lib32z1)

To install the newly created APK on your device, use the following script:
./android/install-kiwix-on-device.sh

== Android Custom App ==

Android Custom App are single-content Kiwix-android clones. Those app
are tied to a single content and CAN NOT open other zim file. As well,
bundled zim files are not readable by the regular Kiwix app. Custom
App have specific branding.

Custom App are either compiled as embed (ZIM file is included in APK)
or are accompanied by a ZIM file.

* Embedded versions can be very large (while Play Store have a 50MB
  limit)
* Non-embedded versions are small (6MB) but require a companion ZIM file
  which can be up to 2GB.
* Companion file is a feature of the Play store.

Steps to build a Custom App:

0. Install following requirements

1. Build your first APK

  package name)

7. Build a second APK
* Change version_code in JSON file
* Rebuild

8. Upload your second APK using the upload script:
$GOOGLE_API_KEY=/home/xxx/google-api.p12
$python3 ./upload-apk.py my-file.json`

9. [whenever you feel the need to] Update Play Store listing using
play-store script.

To update the apk only without a content update:

1. Add the "content_version_code" field to json file and set it to 
the current version code.
Increment the actual version code.

2. Ensure the content file is located locally. Without this the
app will think that it is corrupt.

3. Compile as usual.

4. Sign and upload to the Google Play store.

5. When uploading you are given the choice of which expansion file to use.
Make sure to tell Google the right one.

6. Publish


To make an APK which embeds a ZIM file:
* In the json file, add:
    "embed_zim": true,
* You might need to set up following env. variable:
    _JAVA_OPTIONS="\"-Xmx4096m\" \"-Xms4096m\""
