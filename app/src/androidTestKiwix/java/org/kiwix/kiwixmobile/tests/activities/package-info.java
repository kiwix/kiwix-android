/**
 * These are very simple activity starting and navigation tests.
 * Their purpose is to ensure that navigation is possible without causing crashes.
 *
 * SplashActivity contains various tests of navigating to other activities, along with starting
 * itself.
 *
 * Each test contains:
 *  @Test
 *  public void empty() {
 *
 *  }
 *
 * This forces JUnit to execute the ActivityRule, and then exit immediately (start and stop the Activity)
