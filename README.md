# Kiwix-Android

Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. One of its main purposes
is to make Wikipedia available offline. This is done by reading the
content of a file in the ZIM format, a highly compressed open format
with additional meta-data.

Kiwix is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (with a few old
pieces in Java).

## Build Instructions

Production releases of the app should be built with our companion
build repository [kiwix-build](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-build).

To build this repository alone for development purposes you can simply
import the project into Android Studio and the hard work will be done
for you. If you prefer to build without Android Studio you must first
set up the Android SDK and then run the command: `./gradlew build `
from the root directory of the project.

We utilize different build variants (flavours) to build various
different versions of our app. Ensure your build variant is
`kiwixDebug` to build the standard app.
