# Kiwix Android

Kiwix is an offline reader for Web content. One of its main purposes
is to make Wikipedia available offline. This is done by reading the
content of a file in the ZIM format, a highly compressed open format
with additional meta-data. This is the version for Android.

Kiwix Android is written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) (with a few old
pieces in Java).

## Build Instructions

Production releases of the app are built on travis and released automatically

To build this repository alone for development purposes you can simply
**import** the project into Android Studio and the hard work will be done
for you. Note here that instead of *opening* the project, you have to *import* it. If you prefer to build without Android Studio you must first
set up the Android SDK and then run the command: `./gradlew build `
from the root directory of the project.

Kiwix-Android is a multi-module project, in 99% of scenarios you will want to build the `app` module in the `debug` configuration.
If you are interested in our custom apps they have their own repo [kiwix-android-custom](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-android-custom
) that goes into further detail
