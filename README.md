## Build Instructions

Production releases of the app should be built with our companion build repository [kiwix-build](https://github.com/kiwix/kiwix-build).

To build this repository alone for development purposes you can simply import the project into Android Studio and the hard work will be done for you. If you prefer to build without Android Studio you must first set up the Android SDK and then run the command: ```./gradlew build ``` from the root directory of the project.

We utilize different build variants (flavours) to build various different versions of our app. Ensure your build variant is **kiwixDebug** to build the standard app.
