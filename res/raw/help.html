        <h2>What does Kiwix do?</h2>

        <p><em>Kiwix</em> is an offline content reader. It acts very much like a browser but instead
            of accessing <em>online web pages</em>, it reads content from a file in <em>ZIM
                format</em>.</p>

        <p>While Kiwix has been originaly designed to provide Wikipedia offline, it also reads other
            contents.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="where-do-i-find-content">
        <h2>Where is the content?</h2>

        <p>The contents are located on the <a href="http://kiwix.org/m/">kiwix website</a>.</p>

        <p>They are available as ZIM files. There are <strong>a lot</strong> of them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wikipedia is available separately for each language</li>
            <li>Other contents like Wikileaks or Wikisource are also available</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Carefuly select the one(s) you want and launch the download. Put the resulting files on
            your SD card then open them with Kiwix.</p>

        <p>Depending on the content and your Internet connection on this device, it might be
            preferable to download from a Desktop computer and transfer to your SD card.</p>

    <section id="large-zim">
        <h2>How to use large ZIM files?</h2>

        <p>If your ZIM file weighs more than 4GB, you might not be able to store it on your SD card
            due to filesystem limitations.</p>

        <p>In this case, please split it using one of the following software:</p>
        <ul>
            <li> On Microsoft Windows: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                                          href="http://www.hjsplit.org/">HJ-Split</a>
            </li>
            <li> On Apple Mac OSX: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text"
                                      href="http://loekjehe.home.xs4all.nl/Split&amp;Concat/">Split&amp;Concat</a>
            </li>
            <li> On GNU/Linux and with the console: <code>split --bytes=4000M my_big_file.zim</code>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> your resulting files must be named <code>my_big_file.zimaa</code>,
            <code>my_big_file.zimab</code>, etc.</p>
